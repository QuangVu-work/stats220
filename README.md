# This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

1. I am undertaking [a degree in Science](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/study/study-options/find-a-study-option/bachelor-of-science-bsc.html), majoring in Psychology.
2. I am taking [*STATS 220*](https://courseoutline.auckland.ac.nz/dco/course/STATS/220/1213) because of the course's practical nature.
3. I am interested in learning about:
- data manipulation
- relevant computer technologies.
